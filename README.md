# roshomework
This was created as a simple program, that would suimulate the behaviour of a Turtlebot3 with a differential drive. It listens the data from turtlebot, simulate the control system and drives of the robot, and then plot 2 trajectories: real and ideal one.
Works with ROS1 and Ubuntu Noetic
